#   â™• N-Queen Visualizer (Work in Progress)

This project visualizes the **N-Queens problem** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Currently, it displays a 5Ã—5 board with static queen placements.  
I'm updating it daily to add:
- Dynamic N selection
- Auto solver visualization
- Interactive features

## ðŸ§  Current Status
âœ… Static 5Ã—5 board  
âœ… Queens placed manually  
ðŸ•“ In progress: Dynamic board generation

## ðŸš€ Run it locally
